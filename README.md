# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
My goal is to learn how to normalize data effectively to streamline data analysis down the road. I will also learn how to push commits to GitHub.

## Process
- Download and look through the CSV files to familiarize myself with the data
- Import data into tables
- Using PgAdmin4, clean and normalize the data according to normal forms
- Generate the ERD
- QA the data
- Answer questions

## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

## Challenges 
Trying to figure out the correct primary keys to use for each table was a little challenging, especially when certain values in a column I want to use as a foreign key are not present in the primary key of another table. I had to go back to the data cleaning step a few times to remedy this. As a result a lot of data is lost which will affect future analysis down the line.

I also have no idea how the data in the analytics table was obtained and whether or not duplicate entries are actually separate instances or unique entries. I decided to leave these be since some records would only differ by one value in a column.

## Future Goals
(what would you do if you had more time?)
