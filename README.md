## Project/Goals
My goal is to learn how to normalize data effectively to streamline data analysis down the road. I will also learn how to push commits to GitHub.

## Process

- Import data into tables
- Using PgAdmin4, clean and normalize the data according to normal forms
- Generate the ERD
- QA the data
- Answer questions
